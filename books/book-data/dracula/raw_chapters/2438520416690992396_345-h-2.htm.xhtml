How these papers have been placed in sequence will be made manifest in the
reading of them. All needless matters have been eliminated, so that a history
almost at variance with the possibilities of later-day belief may stand forth
as simple fact. There is throughout no statement of past things wherein memory
may err, for all the records chosen are exactly contemporary, given from the
standpoints and within the range of knowledge of those who made them.
